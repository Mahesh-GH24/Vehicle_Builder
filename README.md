   ## Description

   The initial version of this project was capable of building a car and performing certain actions like start, Reverse etc. Wouldn't be nice to have a multi-vehicle builder that can also build a Truck with towing capabilities and also a motorbike that can do cool movements like Wheelie? That was the motivation behind this project!

   ## Installation
   Make sure you install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

   ## Technologies
   Javascript, node, npm and Typescript with OOP

   ## Usage
   Once the dependencies have been installed, execute the app using the command node index.js to start answering the questions. You can either start by creating a new vehicle or choose an already existing vehicle from the list and perform some cool operations with the vehicle. Ofcourse you have to start a vehicle before you can do a wheelie!! Link to walkthru video demonstrating the app functionality is below - 

   ## Challenges
   Currently the interaction with the user is via command line and not very user friendly

   ## Tests
   Run the app so you are promped with questions.Ensure you are able to perform all the operations provided to you - create a new vehicle or choose from the existing list and perform all the actions.

   ## Future Implementation
   Upgrade the command line application to user friendly front end application using React.

   ## Contributing
   There are amny ways you can contribute - submit a bug or a new feature for future ideas or introduce new features to the app (once approved)
